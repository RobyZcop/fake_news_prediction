# üì∞ Fake News Detection Model

‚úÖ **This project was developed as part of my university semester project to address misinformation using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.**

---

## üìå Project Overview  

The **Fake News Detection Model** is a machine learning-based project that aims to distinguish between real and fake news articles. In an era where misinformation spreads rapidly and can influence public opinion and societal stability, this tool can be instrumental in identifying unreliable content.

Using natural language processing techniques, the model analyzes textual data from news articles to classify them as authentic (`1`) or fake (`0`). The ultimate goal is to integrate this model into a user-friendly browser extension that warns users when they are consuming potentially fake news.

  - TF-IDF vectorization  
- ‚úÖ Binary classification using:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Other ML models (e.g., Random Forest, Naive Bayes)

### üìä Data Exploration and Visualization  
- ‚úÖ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with plots for:
  - Class distribution  
  - Word frequency  
  - Tone and sentiment differences

### üß† Model Training and Evaluation  
- ‚úÖ Evaluates model performance using metrics:
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-score  
- ‚úÖ Confusion matrix to visualize results

## üìÇ Dataset  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Due to size limitations, the dataset is not uploaded to this repository.

The dataset used for this project contains:
- **True news** from reliable sources like *Reuters*, *New York Times*, *Washington Post*  
- **Fake news** from known misinformation platforms and open-source datasets

## üîë Ethical Note  
This project was created for educational and research purposes only. While every effort was made to reduce dataset bias, this model should not be used for real-world or high-risk decisions without extensive validation.
